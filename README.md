# Multiple Choice Question TUI

> 🎨 **Vibe Engineered Project** - This project was developed with AI assistance.

A Rich-based terminal user interface for answering multiple choice questions from YAML files with interactive visual feedback.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
cd mcq-tui
uv pip install -e .

# Run
mcq example_questions.yaml
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting.

## Installation

### Install as CLI Tool

```bash
cd mcq-tui
uv pip install -e .
```

The `mcq` command should now be available. If not found, ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

**Usage:**
```bash
mcq questions.yaml
mcq --help
mcq --version
```

### Development Installation

```bash
cd mcq-tui
uv sync
uv run mcq questions.yaml
```

This creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies. Use `uv run` to execute commands.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
mcq questions.yaml
```

If no file is provided, you'll be prompted to enter the path.

### Example

```bash
mcq example_questions.yaml
```

## Question Types

The TUI supports three question types:

### 1. Single-Select (`type: single` or default)
- Choose one option from a list
- Press number key (1-N) to select, then Enter to confirm
- Option 0 for "Other" (free text input)

### 2. Multi-Select (`type: multi`)
- Select multiple options
- Press number keys (1-N) to toggle selections
- Visual checkmarks show selected options
- Press Enter to confirm

### 3. Yes/No (`type: yesno`)
- Simple Yes/No/Other questions
- Press `1` (Yes), `2` (No), or `3` (Other)
- Also accepts `y`, `n`, `o` for compatibility
- Press Enter to confirm

## YAML Format

The TUI expects YAML files with questions in the following format:

```yaml
title: "Sample Quiz"
description: "A quiz about programming"
author: "John Doe"

questions:
  # Single-select (default)
  - id: 1
    question: "What is the capital of France?"
    type: single
    options:
      - "London"
      - "Paris"
      - "Berlin"
      - "Madrid"
  
  # Multi-select
  - id: 2
    question: "Which programming languages do you know? (Select all that apply)"
    type: multi
    options:
      - "Python"
      - "JavaScript"
      - "Rust"
      - "Go"
  
  # Yes/No
  - id: 3
    question: "Do you prefer Python over JavaScript?"
    type: yesno
```

After answering questions, the YAML file will be updated with answers:

```yaml
questions:
  - id: 1
    question: "What is the capital of France?"
    type: single
    options:
      - "London"
      - "Paris"
      - "Berlin"
      - "Madrid"
    answer:
      index: 2
      option: "Paris"
metadata:
  last_answered: "2025-12-18T10:36:27.096193"
  answered_count: 1
  total_questions: 3
```

**Format Rules:**
- Root level: `title`, `description`, `author` (all optional)
- `questions` array contains question objects
- Each question has:
  - `id` (optional): Unique identifier for the question (string or number)
  - `question` (required): The question text
  - `type` (optional): `single`, `multi`, or `yesno` (defaults to `single`)
  - `options` (required for `single` and `multi`, optional for `yesno`): Array of option strings
- Options are displayed as numbered choices (1, 2, 3...)
- Option 0 is always "Other" for single-select questions

**Answer Storage:**
- Answers are automatically saved back to the YAML file when you finish or exit
- Each answered question gets an `answer` field with the selected response
- A `metadata` section is added with timestamp and statistics
- Answers persist in the same file, making it easy to share results with agents or review later
